Dynamic factor analysis is based on the assumption that a small number of latent variables generate the observed time series trough a stochastically perturbed linear structure.

## Background Knowledge
DFMs were developed by Geweke(1977)

## Model 
Following the notation of Stock and Watson(2010), Let $X_t$ denote an $m\times 1$ vector of observable variables, and $f_t$ denote a %q\times 1% vector of latent factors. Then a generic representation of a DFM is of the form
