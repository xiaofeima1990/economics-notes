# Industrial Organization 

## Introduction 

### science and research field : problem-orientated


**Economics is not about equilibrium or optimization. It is about trying to understand certain phenomena and is defined by the set of questions, not a set of methods. Methods change but the questions do not.**

I think it is absulately right, the techniques and research styles vary all the time but the questions remains the same. Therefore, it is approiprate to define or differentiate fields or subjects by questions.

So what is the questions in Industrial Organization? 

* What determines the form and intensity of competition within an industry?
	* What determines industry norms of behavior?
	* What determines the extent of price competition/collusion?
	* What determines the dimensions upon which firms compete?
	* What is the effect of the number of firms on price-cost margins?
* What determines the extent of potential competition?
	* What determines the ease of entry?
	* What determines how active firms respond to the threat of entry?
* What determines asymmetries among firms?
	* What determines whether a firm or a few firms dominate an industry?
	* What determines the creation of dominance
	* What determines sustained dominance?
	* Is there increasing or decreasing dominance? Is it good or bad for welfare that an industry is dominated by a few firms?
