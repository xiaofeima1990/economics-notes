\begin_layout Title
Agricultural Household Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In developing countries, people who are farmer are very special.
 Because they earn at least part of their livelihood through work in their
 own enterprises(the land).
 At the same time, they also can consume a portion of their product(they
 grow crops, harvest them, sell them or eat them).
 We know that due to the unique feature of agriculture, household labour
 is often an important input into the production process of the farmer's
 production activity.
 Consequently, Consequently, individuals make simultaneous decisions about
 production (the level of output, the demand for factors, and the choice
 of technology) and consumption (labor supply and commodity demand).
 This mixture just describes common daily life of most families in developing
 countries and provides starting point (Agricultural Household Model) for
 our analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Baseline Model Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical model of an agricultural household includes a utility function,
 defined over consumption by each member of the household (usually can be
 simplified by one or two members), and a budget constraint, which incorporates
 production on assets owned by the household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a typical household with two household members whose aggregate
 utility is represented by a household utility function: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\max U(c_{1},c_{2},l_{1},l_{2})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where each member gets utility from consuming a good (
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 ) and from leisure( 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

 ).
 Utility is an increasing function of both 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
he most simple agricultural household models assume that each household
 faces a complete set of competitive markets.
 (This includes, in more general models than the one presented here, a complete
 set of markets for time- and state-indexed commodities.) Such assumption
 can be released in the following extending part
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
About the Budget Constrains, we have the following setup: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 be the price of output, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 be the wage of output (for simplicity, that the labor of the two family
 members is homogeneous.) The household can produce the good on its farm
 according to the concave production function 
\begin_inset Formula $F(L,A)$
\end_inset

, where A is the area of the farm cultivated by the household and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the amount of labour used on the farm.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}^{L}$
\end_inset

 be person's endowment of time, 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{A}$
\end_inset

 the household's endowment of land, and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 the price of one unit of land.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
p(c_{1}+c_{2})+wL^{h}+rA^{h} & \leq & F(L,A)+w(L_{1}^{m}+L_{2}^{m})+rA^{m}\\
L & = & L_{1}^{f}+L_{2}^{f}+L^{h}\\
A & = & A^{f}+A_{h}\\
E^{A} & = & A^{f}+A^{m},E_{i}^{L}=L_{i}^{f}+L_{i}^{m}+l_{i},i\in\{1,2\}\\
c_{i},l_{i},L_{i}^{f},L_{i}^{m},A^{f},A^{m} & \geq & 0,\ i\in\{1,2\}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(*) is the budget constraint which tells us cash expenditures on consumption,
 hired labour(
\begin_inset Formula $L^{h}$
\end_inset

), and rented land (
\begin_inset Formula $A^{h}$
\end_inset

) cannot exceed cash revenues from farming, market labour (rented labour
 $L_i^m$, and land rented out (
\begin_inset Formula $A^{m}$
\end_inset

).
 the rest equations are resource constraints: labour use on the farm is
 household labour used on the farm plus hired labour; land use on the farm
 is owned land used on the farm plus hired land; the household's land endowment
 is used on its own farm or rented out, and each individual's time endowment
 equals their labour use on the farm, plus market labour time, plus leisure
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
maximization 
\series default
is with respect to consumption and leisure, hired labour and land, and household
 labour and land supplied to the market and used on the household farm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
when we substitute the (3)-(5) into (*), we have: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
p(c_{1}+c_{2})+w(l_{1}+l_{2}) & \leq & \Pi+w(E_{1}^{L}+E_{2}^{L})+rE^{A}\label{eq:bc}\\
\Pi & = & F(L,A)-wL-rA\\
c_{i},l_{i},L,A & \geq & 0,\ i\in\{1,2\}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bc"

\end_inset

is called the ‘full-income’ constraint: the value of consumption cannot
 exceed the value of the household's endowment plus farm profits.
 The household's problem is now to maximize (1) (with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $L,A,c_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}$
\end_inset

 ) subject to (7)–(9).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three Key things to notices: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
none
\series default
 of the variables in (7), the equation for farm profits is in (1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
all
\series default
 of the variables in (1) are on the left side (and none are on the right
 side) of (7)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
all variables on the right side of (7) other than Π are fixed 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as 
\begin_inset Formula $U()$
\end_inset

 is characterized by local non-satiation, then (7) is binding at the solution
 and the maximized value of 
\begin_inset Formula $U()$
\end_inset

 is increasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that L and A can first be chosen to maximize prifit 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi$
\end_inset

, and thus maximize the right side of (7), and then 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2},l_{1}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be chosen to maximize (1) subject to (7).
 This ability to “separate” the maximization problem into two steps is called
 the separability property of this model of agricultural households, because
 the production decisions of the household are separable from the household's
 consumption choices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The separation property is robust to the non-existence of some markets.
 For example, if there is no land market, then replace 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{A}$
\end_inset

 in (8) and set 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

.
 The problem remains recursive, and the household chooses labour inputs
 to maximize profits given the household's endowment of land.
 This choice is independent of the household's preferences or endowment
 of labour.
 An analogous result is true if there is no labour market but land can be
 traded freely.
 Thus, the household's decision-making process can be divided in two stages:
 first, farm profit is maximized, and then utility is maximized given the
 full income budget constraint.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
we can simplify the model and describe it by graph.
 Suppose that U(·) is such that at all prices and wages 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}=c_{2}=c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}=l_{2}=l$
\end_inset

.
 Again, assuming that there is no market for land, the household chooses
 
\begin_inset Formula $c,l,$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $L.$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $F(L,E^{A})$
\end_inset

 is the production function on the household farm, given land endowment
 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{A}$
\end_inset

 .
 Given the real wage rate w/p, farm profits are maximized at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi(w/p.E^{A})$
\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{*}$
\end_inset

units of labour on the farm (
\begin_inset Formula $L^{*}=argmax\{F(L,E^{A})-(w/p)L\}$
\end_inset

 ), Then, given the budget constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $pc=wE^{L}+\Pi(w/p.E^{A})-wl$
\end_inset

 .
 household utility is maximized by choosing consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{*}$
\end_inset

 and leisure 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{*}$
\end_inset

.

 be on the edge of

\begin_layout Section
Incomplete Market
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If multiple markets are incomplete, the separation property may no longer
 hold.
 The household no longer maximizes profit functions, and production decisions
 depend upon the preferences and endowments of the household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
imperfections in both the land and labour markets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
A classic example
\series default
 is the problem of a household that faces imperfections in both the land
 and labour markets.
 Suppose again that there is no market for land, but now add the possibility
 that there is some involuntary unemployment in the rural labour market.
 The household cultivates its endowment of land, and might face a binding
 constraint on the amount of labour it can supply off its own farm.
 The household problem (now assuming just one person in the household) is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\max_{c,l,L^{H},L^{F}}U(c,l)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
subject to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
pc & = & F(L^{f}+L^{h},E^{A})-wL^{h}+wL^{m}\\
E^{L} & = & l+L^{f}+L^{m}\\
L^{m} & \leq & M
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $L^{h}$
\end_inset

 is labour hired by the household to work on its farm,
\begin_inset Formula $L^{f}$
\end_inset

 is the household's own labour on its farm, 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{m}$
\end_inset

 is the time spent by the household working for a wage.
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the maximum amount of time the household can spend working for a wage
 as a result of some (here unmodelled) labour market rationing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
not binding 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
if 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{m}\leq M$
\end_inset

 is not binding, then (11) becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $pc+wl=F(L,EA)−wL+wE^{L}$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the amount of labour used on the farm.
 In this case, the household maximizes profits and the separation property
 holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If separation holds, and the production function has constant returns to
 scale (CRTS), then all farms are identical.
 With CRTS, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $F(L,E^{A})=E^{A}f(L/E^{A})$
\end_inset

, and the first-order condition for labour use is 
\begin_inset Formula $w=f′(L/E^{A})$
\end_inset

.
 All unconstrained farmers facing the same wage will use the same amount
 of labour per hectare, and achieve the same yield (output per unit of area)
 and output per unit of labour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
binding 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{m}=M,L^{h}=0$
\end_inset

.
 The household's problem becomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\max_{c,l}U(c,l)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
subject to

\begin_layout Standard

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
first order conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{l}/U_{c}=F_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 The household's problem is illustrated in figure 2 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
inner axes demonstrate production on the household's farm, with output on
 the vertical axis and labour input on the horizontal axis.
 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 hours are spent working in the market, earning 
\begin_inset Formula $wM$
\end_inset

.
 The household's remaining labour time (
\begin_inset Formula $L^{f}$
\end_inset

 ) is spent on the farm, producing 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{*}$
\end_inset

 .
 So the household works 
\begin_inset Formula $M+L^{f}$
\end_inset

 hours and consumes 
\begin_inset Formula $pc^{*}=wM+F(L^{f},E^{A})$
\end_inset

 units of the good.
 The household achieves a maximized utility of 
\begin_inset Formula $U(c^{*},l^{*})$
\end_inset

 at point 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The household's production choice clearly depends on its preferences and
 its endowment, and the separation property does not hold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sort of market structure could give rise to an oft-observed pattern
 in the rural areas of less developed countries.
 Many observers find that 
\series bold
small farms
\series default
 are often cultivated more intensively than 
\series bold
large farm
\series default
s.
 More labour per unit area is used on small farms, and yields are larger
 on these smaller farms.
 Consider a household with more land than the household consuming at point
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, but facing the same wage and labour market constraint.
 If this household were to cultivate with the same intensity as household
 A, it would have to choose to produce and consume at point 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in the figure.
 If leisure is a normal good,
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 will not be chosen.
 Instead, the household will choose to produce and consume at a point such
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

,cultivating its larger farm less intensively than the smaller farm of household
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by implicitly differentiating the first-order condition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dE^{A}}=...<\frac{L}{E^{A}}\ if\ U_{cl}\geq0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Labour and land market imperfections are perhaps the most straightforward
 rationale for an inverse relationship between farm size and cultivation
 intensity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Risk-Averse 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
suppose that labour markets work well and the production function is CRTS
 but that production is risky, households are risk-averse, and insurance
 markets do not exist.
 To simplify this problem, suppose that households supply labour inelastically
 and that there is only a single good.
 The household's problem is to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\max_{L\geq0}EU(c)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
subject to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c=\theta E^{A}f(\frac{L}{E^{A}})-wL+wE^{L}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $θ$
\end_inset

 is a random variable with positive support and mean one.
 The household chooses labour so that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
EU^{'}(c)[\theta f^{'}(\frac{L}{E^{A}})-w]=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The separation property, therefore, does not hold.
 The above equation can be expressed as :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
f^{'}EU^{'}(\theta-1) & = & EU^{'}(w-f^{'})\\
E\theta & = & 1\\
f^{'}cov(U^{'},\theta) & = & (w-f^{'})EU^{'}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumption increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $θ$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $cov(U′,θ)<0$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{′}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $EU^{'}$
\end_inset

are both positive, so 
\begin_inset Formula $w<f^{'}.$
\end_inset

This land is farmed less intensively than land that is cultivated under
 (expected) profit maximization.
 We have shown that a combination of labour, land, and/or insurance market
 failures could be associated with this observation; it is possible to construct
 simple models of financial market imperfections that lead to the same observati
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
unitary household model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In setting up the problem of the household, we rather simply wrote down
 a‘household utility function’ , which depended upon the leisure and consumption
 vector of each of the two individuals in the household.
 This approach is called 
\emph on
unitary household model
\emph default
.
 The standard demand theory applies in this context, and empirical implementatio
n is straightforward.
 Indeed the econometrician is often only able to observe aggregate household
 behavior.
 But such setup , the unitary model of the household, has increasingly come
 under attack on both the theoretical and empirical fronts.
 In the unitary framework, the process by which individual preferences get
 aggregated into a household utility function is essentially a“black box”;
 issues such as intra household inequality and household formation/dissolution
 cannot be handled very well.
 On the empirical side, important predictions of the unitary model have
 consistently failed to find support in the data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest case is that of a household that consumes only private goods
 and whose members have identical homothetic preferences.
 If this household always achieved a Pareto-efficient allocation of resources
 within the household, then by the second welfare theorem this allocation
 could be achieved through a competitive equilibrium within the household.
 Since the income-consumption paths of the members of the household are
 parallel lines, aggregate demand is independent of the distribution of
 income (and utility) within the household.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us take an example of unitary model: Consider a two-member household
 consisting of a husband and wife, indexed respectively by h and w .
 The husband and wife each has an individual utility function that depends
 on own consumption of private goods, but by consensus 2 ,they agree to
 maximize a social welfare function of their individual utilities, subject
 to a single budget constraint that pools together the two individual incomes.
 Let c h and c w denote the consumption, and y h and y w denote the income,
 of the husband and wife.
 The household’s problem is equivalent to maximizing a single utility function,
 U ,subject to a pooled budget constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\max_{c^{h},c^{w}}U(c^{h},c^{w})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p^{h}c^{h}+p^{w}c^{w}=y^{h}+y^{w}=y
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{h}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{w}$
\end_inset

 are the prices of the husband’s and wife’s consumption and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is defined as the households total income, i.e.
 the sum of the husband’s and wife’s income.
 Solving the household maximization problem yields demand functions, f h
 and f w that depend only on prices and total income.
 Formally, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c^{i}=f^{i}(p^{h},p^{w},y)\ i=h,w
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A central prediction of the unitary model of the household is income pooling,
 which is the idea that the household’s demands depend only on its total
 income, y ,and not on the sources of income.
 Empirically, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
if total income is held constant, a change in the sources of income would
 have no effect on demands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
marginal increase in one source of income has the exact same e ff ect on
 demands as a marginal increase in any other source of income
